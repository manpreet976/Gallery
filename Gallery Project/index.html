            We would like to present hand painted oil on canvas painting (recreation) of Afremov's artwork mentioned in the title. The piece is created with oil paint on artistic canvas using Afremov's unique technique of a palette knife. The artwork has a lot of texture, you can feel the strokes by touching this painting. </p>
